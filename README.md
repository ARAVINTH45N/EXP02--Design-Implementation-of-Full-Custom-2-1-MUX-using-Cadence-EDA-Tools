# Ex No: 02 - Design & Implementation of Full Custom 2:1 MUX using Cadence EDA Tools

## Aim

The aim is to design and simulate a full custom 2:1 multiplexer (MUX) using Cadence EDA tools, ensuring accurate logic operation through waveform analysis and verification.

## Tools Required

### Cadence EDA Suite
- **Virtuoso Schematic Editor** (for circuit design)
- **Spectre Simulator** (for circuit simulation)

### Process Design Kit (PDK)
- CMOS technology library (e.g., 180nm, 45nm node)

### Computer System
- Minimum **4GB RAM** and a **multi-core processor**

## Procedure

### 1. Launch Cadence Virtuoso Environment
- Open the Cadence Virtuoso tool and set up the working library.
- Create a new schematic cell view for the 2:1 MUX design.

### 2. Schematic Design
- Select NMOS and PMOS transistors from the library.
- Implement the following logic equation for the 2:1 MUX output:  
  **Y = (A · S′) + (B · S)**
- Connect the respective transistors to form the desired logic.
- Assign input voltage sources for control signal (S) and data inputs (A and B).

### 3. Simulation
- Verify the schematic design for connection errors.
- Launch the Analog Design Environment (ADE).
- Configure transient analysis to observe switching behavior.
- Set simulation parameters such as voltage levels, sweep range, and step size.
- Use Spectre simulator to perform the analysis.

### 4. Waveform Analysis
- Observe the output waveform to ensure correct MUX functionality.
- Confirm that the output reflects the selected input (A or B) based on the control signal (S).
